# Crochet Companion: 
The objective of this project is to build a functional cross-platform app for crochet/knitting, with multiple useful features that will be listed in the next section. 
This project is also a learning experience on how to develop desktop applications and learn how to implement concepts to reality.

# Features(Intended): 
- Image To Pixel Grid ( with variable parameters).
- Crochet Stitch Identifier ( upload an image of a stitch and identify the stitch ).
- Crochet Pattern Modelling

# Features(Potential): 
- Integrate with Ravelry API to fetch patterns.
- Crochet/Knit Pattern Simulator (to make visualizing your patterns easier.)

# Tech Stack (Intended):
- Tauri (to package the application and for cross-platform interoperability.)
- Svelte (to build the UI of the app.)
- Three.js (for crochet/knit modelling.)
- Python  (for crochet stitch identification)
